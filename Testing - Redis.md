## TESTING - REDIS SERVICE CATALOG
### What is Redis?
Redis (short for Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data store that is primarily used as a:
Database
Cache
Message broker

## Objective
To deploy Redis on a Docker container inside an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance and test its functionality using three monitoring tools: Memory Usage Monitor, Latency Checker, and Ping Check. The goal is to ensure the Redis server is operating efficiently, detect any performance or connectivity issues early, and document the complete setup with clear, step-by-step instructions and visuals.

##  Prerequisites
AWS account with an EC2 instance (Ubuntu)
Docker installed on the EC2 instance
Security group configured to allow port 6379 (default Redis port)
Public IP address available to access Redis remotely
Access to a monitoring dashboard or custom monitoring scripts

## Implementation Steps 
## Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance
### Description:
Create a new EC2 instance using the AWS Console with the following settings:
AMI: Ubuntu Server (20.04 or 22.04)
Instance Type: t2.micro (for testing)
Key Pair: created a redis.pem key pair
Security Group: Allow port 6379 and SSH (port 22)

## Step 2: Connect to EC2 Instance via SSH
### Description:
Once your EC2 instance is running, connect to it from your local machine using SSH and the downloaded key.

## Step 1: Install Redis
Update and install Redis server:
Updates the local package index so Ubuntu knows the latest available versions of software. Itâ€™s always a good practice to run this before installing any new software.
```
 sudo apt update
```
